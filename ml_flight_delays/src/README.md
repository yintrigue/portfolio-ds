# Predicting Flight Delays

Please view the **Databricks notebooks** below if GitHub is unable to render the Jupyter notebooks properly. 

- [**Master Notebook**](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_model_master.html) includes the writeup and source does for the entire pipeline from end to end.
- [**EDA Notebook**](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_eda.html) includes the 18 EDAs prior to data engineering and model building.
- [**Data Cleaning/Join Notebook**](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_data_cleaning_join.html) includes the source codes and detailed description on how the 5 datasets are cleaned, verified, and joined.
- [**GBT Toy Example Notebook**](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_toy_ex.html) is an attempt to demonstrate the math behind Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) using a simple NumPy example. 

The end-to-end training pipeline built for the study is summarized as follow:

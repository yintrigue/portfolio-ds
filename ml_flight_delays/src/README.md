In the case if GitHub is unable to the notebooks, please view the HTML formats instead. 

- **Master** ([HTML](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_model_master.html), [IPYNB](fp_model_master.ipynb)) includes the writeup and source does for the entire pipeline from end to end.
- **EDA** ([HTML](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_eda.html), [IPYNB](fp_eda.ipynb)) includes the 18 EDAs prior to data engineering and model building.
- **Data Cleaning/Join** ([HTML](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_data_cleaning_join.html), [IPYNB](fp_data_cleaning_join.ipynb)) includes the source codes and detailed description on how the 5 datasets are cleaned, verified, and joined.
- **GBT Toy Example** ([HTML](https://yintrigue.github.io/ml_flight_delays/src/html/fp_toy_ex.html), [IPYNB](fp_toy_ex.ipynb)) is an attempt to demonstrate the math behind Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) using a simple NumPy example. 

The end-to-end training pipeline built for the study is summarized as follow:

## Machine Learning

### [Melanoma Classification](./melanoma)  
*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on images of skin lesions and patient metadata. The dataset consists of a total of **33,126** full-color, high-resolution images but with only **584** positive examples. Three neural network models and two baseline models (Logistic Regression and SVM) were built with an exploratory study on visualizing the learning process of EfficientNet B0.

**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS, Python
**ML Algorithms**:  Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, PCA

### Neural Net Visualization 

The project explores ways to visualize the learning progress of EfficientNet B0 (a convolutional neural network introduced by Google) by extracting its embedding and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using PCA .

**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS, Python
**ML Algorithms:** Convolutional Neural Network, PCA

## Python Development

### [AweseomBabyNames](./awesome_baby_names)

An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! AwesomeBabyName is a python terminal app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python

### [Snaky](.snaky/)

Snaky is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake, but with twists specifically designed for training in neural network. 

**Tech Stack:** PyGame, Python

### [Death-Zone Mountaineering](./himalayan_db)

Death-Zone Mountaineering is an analytics research the explores the expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks with altitudes above 8,000m in the Himalayas mountain range. The research is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering all expeditions from 1905 through Spring 2019.

**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, PyWaffle, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy

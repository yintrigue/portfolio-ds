## Machine Learning

### [NT5?! Training T5 to Perform Numerical Reasoning](./ml_nt5)  

**Final Model**: T5, SentencePiece
**Baseline Model**: BERT  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS      

*NT5?! Training T5 to Perform Numerical Reasoning* is a NLP research on NRoT (numerical reasoning over text) using T5. We are currently in the process of refining the research in response to feedback from the ACL submission.   

### [Predicting Airline Delays](./ml_airlines)  

**Final Model**: Gradient Boosted Tree
**Baseline Models**: XGBoost Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM Classifier,   
**Tech Stack**: Sparks, Scikit-learn, Databricks, AWS

### [Classifying Melanoma](./ml_melanoma)  

**Final Model**: EfficientNet-B07
**Baseline Models**: CNN, CNN + Feedforward NN (Concatenation), Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, Focal Loss  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS    

*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on patient metadata and images of skin lesions. Two datasets are used for the classification: a **CSV (~2MB)** that contains textual patient metadata, and an **image pool (40GB+)** that consists of 33,126 skin lesion photos, of which there are **only 584 positive examples**. A total of three **neural networks** and two baseline models (**Logistic Regression** and **SVM**) are built for the classification.

### [Visualizing EfficientNet](./ml_visualizing_neural_net)  
**Models:** EfficientNet-B0, PCA, Focal Loss  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS     

The study explores ways to visualize the learning progress of **EfficientNet** (a convolutional neural network published by Google in 2019) by extracting embeddings and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using **PCA**.

### [Neural Snaky](./ml_snaky) 
**Final Model**: Neural Network
**Baseline Model**: Logistics  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyGame     

*Snaky* is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake. There is a twist: the snake plays the game by itself with a brain made of a neural network! 

### [Mini ML Projects @ Berkeley](./ml_berkeley) 

**Models**: KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistics, PCA, K-Means Clustering  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyGame

## Statistical Analysis

### [Field Experiment: Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing](./st_gender_bias)  

**Keywords**: Randomized Field Experiment, 2x2 Factorial Design, Blocking, Power Analysis, OLS, ANOVA  
**Tech Stack**: R  

*Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing* is a statistical research project with **an end-to-end** **randomized field experiment** that includes experiment design, data collection, and model building. Multiple other academic researches on similar topics have been conducted and are discussed in the paper.   

### [Regression: Quality on Popularity for YouTube Videos](./st_youtube)  

**Keywords**: OLS, Gauss-Markov Assumptions, Omitted Variable Bias  
**Tech Stack**: R

The study includes an **end-to-end regression analysis**, including an analysis on the **Gaussâ€“Markov assumptions** and **omitted variable bias**, in an attempt to explore the relationship between a video's quality and its popularity one YouTube. In particular, we ask the question: How does the quality of a video affect its number of views?

## Data Exploration  

### [AwesomeBabyNames](./py_awesome_baby_names)  
**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python  

An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! *AwesomeBabyNames* is a Python app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

### [Visualizing Death-Zone Mountaineering](./py_himalayan_db)  
**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy, Python  

*Death-Zone Mountaineering* is an analysis on expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks (i.e. peaks with altitudes above 8,000m) in the Himalayas mountain range. The data visualization project is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering **over 100 years of expeditions** from 1905 through Spring 2019.

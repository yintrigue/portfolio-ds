## Machine Learning

### [Classifying Melanoma](./ml_melanoma)  
**Models**: Neural Network, EfficientNet, Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, Focal Loss
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS, Python  

*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on patient metadata and images of skin lesions. Two datasets are used for the classification: a **CSV (~2MB)** that contains textual patient metadata, and an **image pool (40GB+)** that consists of 33,126 skin lesion photos, of which there are **only 584 positive examples**. A total of three **neural networks** and two baseline models (**Logistic Regression** and **SVM**) are built for the classification.

### [Visualizing EfficientNet](./ml_visualizing_neural_net)  
**Models:** EfficientNet-B0, PCA, Focal Loss  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS, Python   

The study explores ways to visualize the learning progress of **EfficientNet** (a convolutional neural network published by Google in 2019) by extracting embeddings and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using **PCA**.

### [Neural Snaky](./py_snaky) 
**Models**: Neural Network, Logistics  
**Tech Stack:** PyGame, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Python  
*Snaky* is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake. There is a twist: the snake plays the game by itself with a brain made of a neural network!

## Data Exploration  
### [AwesomeBabyNames](./py_awesome_baby_names)  
**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python  
An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! *AwesomeBabyNames* is a Python app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

### [Visualizing Death-Zone Mountaineering](./py_himalayan_db)  
**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy, Python  
*Death-Zone Mountaineering* is an analysis on expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks (i.e. peaks with altitudes above 8,000m) in the Himalayas mountain range. The data visualization project is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering **over 100 years of expeditions** from 1905 through Spring 2019.![image]

## Statistical Analysis

### [Field Experiment: Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing](./st_gender_bias)  
**Keywords**: Randomized Field Experiment, 2x2 Factorial Design, Blocking, Power Analysis, OLS, ANOVA  
**Tech Stack**: R  
*Gender Bias in Auto Repair Pricing* is a statistical research project with **an end-to-end** **randomized field experiment** that includes experiment design, data collection, and model building. Multiple other academic researches on similar topics have been conducted and are discussed in the paper.

## Other Works

### [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/)  

Before data science I was a software engineer at a WPP agency leading the development of online interactive experiences for clients including Nike and EA Game  (e.g. e-commerce, games, data visualization, web development, etc.). [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/) is a portfolio of select professional and personal projects that I have worked on prior to data science.  

### [Hello Baby Clara!](./sp_hello_baby_clara)  

**Tech Stack:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS  
*Hello Baby Clara!* is a photo diary web application built using PHP and jQuery. It is a highly visual and interactive experience designed to be enjoyed by both farther (me) and daughter (Clara).  

### [Yintrigue.com](https://yintrigue.com/)  

**Tech Stack:** Nikon  
I am a semi-professional photographer at my own free time and love traveling around the world to explore the beauty of nature. [Yintrigue.com](https://yintrigue.com) is my photography portfolio that I built to showcase my 15+ years of works. ðŸ˜ƒ

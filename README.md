### Melanoma Classification 

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yintrigue/portfolio-ds/tree/master/melanoma) | Slides

[SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on images of skin lesions and patient metadata. The dataset consists of a total of 33,126 full-color, high-resolution images but with only 584 positive examples. Three models (CNN, SVM, and LR) were built, and an exploratory study on visualizing the learning process of EfficientNet B0  was conducted.

Algorithms:  
Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, PCA

Tech Stack:  
TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Python, TPU, GCS

Before data science, I was a software engineer (e-commerce development) at WPP and a analytics product manager (online advertising) at Microsoft. This section is a compilation of my select e-commerce development and UX projects in the past.

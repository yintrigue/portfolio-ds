## Machine Learning

### [Classifying Melanoma](./melanoma)  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS, Python  
**Algorithms**: Neural Network, EfficientNet, Focal Loss, SVM, Logistic Regression, PCA  

*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on images of skin lesions and patient metadata. The dataset consists of a total of **33,126** full-color, high-resolution images but with only **584** positive examples. Three neural network models and two baseline models (Logistic Regression and SVM) were built with an exploratory study on visualizing the learning process of EfficientNet B0.

### [Visualizing EfficientNet-B0](./visualizing_neural_net)  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS, Python  
**Algorithms:** PCA, Convolutional Neural Network, EfficientNet-B0, Focal Loss  

The project explores ways to visualize the learning progress of EfficientNet B0 (a convolutional neural network introduced by Google) by extracting its embedding and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using PCA .

## Python Development  
### [Death-Zone Mountaineering](./himalayan_db)  
**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, PyWaffle, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy, Python  
Death-Zone Mountaineering is an analytics research the explores the expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks with altitudes above 8,000m in the Himalayas mountain range. The research is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering all expeditions from 1905 through Spring 2019.

### [AweseomBabyNames](./awesome_baby_names)  
**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python  
An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! AwesomeBabyName is a python terminal app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

### [Snaky](./snaky)  
**Tech Stack:** PyGame, Python  
Snaky is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake, but with twists specifically designed for training in neural network.

## Other Projects

### [Hello Baby Clara!](./hello_baby_clara)  
**Tech Stack:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS  
*Hello Baby Clara!* is a photo diary web application built using PHP and jQuery. It is a highly visual and interactive experience designed to be enjoyed by both the farther (me) and daughter (Clara).

### [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/)

Before data science I was a software engineer at WPP leading the development of various interactive experiences online (e.g. e-commerce, games, data visualization, etc.) for clients such as Nike and EA Game. [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/) is a portfolio of select web development projects that I have worked on.

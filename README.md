SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification ([competition homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification)) is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on images of skin lesions and patient metadata. The dataset consists of 33,126 full-color, high-resolution images with only 584 positive examples. Three models (CNN, SVM, and LR) were built, and an in-depth exploratory study on visualizing the learning process of Google's EfficientNet B0  was conducted.

## Other Projects

Before data science, I was a software engineer (e-commerce development) at WPP and a analytics product manager (online advertising) at Microsoft. This section is a compilation of my select e-commerce development and UX projects in the past.

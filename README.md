## Machine Learning

### [Classifying Melanoma](./ml_melanoma)  
**Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, TPU, GCS, Python  
**Algorithms**: Neural Network, EfficientNet, Focal Loss, SVM, Logistic Regression, PCA  

*SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification* is an annual Kaggle competition on identifying the deadly skin cancer, Melanoma, based on images of skin lesions and patient metadata. The training dataset consists of a total of **33,126 images (40+ GB)**, of which only **584 positive examples** are included. Three **neural networks** and two baseline models (**Logistic Regression** and **SVM**) were built. An exploratory study using **PCA** on visualizing the learning process of EfficientNet B0 is also performed.

### [Visualizing EfficientNet-B0](./ml_visualizing_neural_net)  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, TPU, GCS, Python  
**Algorithms:** PCA, Convolutional Neural Network, EfficientNet-B0, Focal Loss  

The project explores ways to visualize the learning progress of **EfficientNet B0** (a convolutional neural network introduced by Google in 2019) by extracting its embedding and projecting the extracted features onto a 2D plane using **PCA**.

### [Snaky](./py_snaky)  
**Tech Stack:** PyGame, Python  
*Snaky* is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake, but with twists specifically designed for training in neural network.

## Python Development  
### [AwesomeBabyNames](./py_awesome_baby_names)  
**Tech Stack**: MVC, SQLite, Python  
An awesome baby starts with an awesome name! *AwesomeBabyNames* is a Python app that helps you come up with a great name for your baby by visualizing **100+ years of census data** collected by the US government.

### [Visualizing Death-Zone Mountaineering](./py_himalayan_db)  
**Tech Stack:** Plotly, Seaborn, GeoPy, Pandas, NumPy, Python  
*Death-Zone Mountaineering* is an analysis on expeditions to the 16 eight-thousander peaks (i.e. peaks with altitudes above 8,000m) in the Himalayas mountain range. The data visualization project is primarily based on the *Himalayan Database*, covering **over 100 years of expeditions** from 1905 through Spring 2019.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57857777/115339501-be315f00-a159-11eb-9c2e-e4491cd2b38e.png)

## Other Projects

### [Hello Baby Clara!](./sp_hello_baby_clara)  
**Tech Stack:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS  
*Hello Baby Clara!* is a photo diary web application built using PHP and jQuery. It is a highly visual and interactive experience designed to be enjoyed by both farther (me) and daughter (Clara).

### [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/)  

Before data science I was a software engineer at WPP leading the development of various interactive experiences for clients including Nike and EA Game  (e.g. e-commerce, games, data visualization, etc.). [Yintegral.com](https://yintegral.com/) is a portfolio of select professional and personal projects that I have worked on prior to data science.

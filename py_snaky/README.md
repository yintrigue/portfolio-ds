## Description
Snaky is a PyGame implementation of the classic game, Snake. The goal is not to develop a fully playable game, but rather an implementation specifically for training in neural network. Key features include:
- Option to save and replay history stored in CSV
- Dimension and resolution of the game board are adjustable, which enables experiments in neural network
- Customizable sprites & OOP for ease of future extension

## Description
**Tech Stack:** Scikit-learn, Python 
**Algorithms:** GMM, K-means Clustering, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes

The section includes select machine learning projects from UC Berkeley. Multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to build classifiers and explore various datasets.

- `nn_visualization.ipynb` is the notebook for the analysis.
- `lib.py` is the Python module that contains all the classes and functions used for constructing the CNN model.
- `./img` contains the images used for the readme markdown.

# Hello Baby Clara!  
**v0.8.3**

**Tech Stack:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS

## Description
Before data science I was a software engineer. To this date, I continue to enjoy working on web development projects at my own free time. *Hello Baby Clara!* is an interactive web experience that I created to document my daughter's growth since 2017. The website is functional but currently in development with performance latency issues to be resolved:

Technically speaking, *Hello Baby Clara!* is a single-page web application designed for storytelling using photos and text diaries. Key features include:

- Layout is dynamically generated and fully responsive.
- Layout can be zoomed in/out for an optimal browsing experience.
- Photos and diaries are progressively loaded as the page is scrolled down, helping reduce bandwidth despite high-resolution photos.
- No database is required. All contents are loaded/rendered based on directory structure and EXIF tags. The web app can be ported by a simple copy-and-paste.
- User login is supported for viewing private photos and diaries.
- Fun interactive experience with sound effects. This is a project to be enjoyed by both farther and daughter!

Note: *Hello Baby Clara!* is built from the ground up using jQuery and a number of third-party libraries. The reason for not using Angular or React is to avoid design limitation imposed by the frameworks in addition to keeping things simple and flexible.
